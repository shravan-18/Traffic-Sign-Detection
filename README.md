# Traffic Sign Classification with WCM-DCGAN and Xception-Enhanced Vision Transformer

This repository showcases my work on generating and classifying weather-conditioned traffic sign images using a custom GAN and Vision Transformer. By introducing a **Weather Conditioning Module (WCM)** into a traditional **DCGAN**, I generated realistic traffic sign images under various weather conditions. These images were later processed through an **Xception-backbone Vision Transformer**, improving classification accuracy in adverse scenarios.

## Architecture Overview

### WCM-DCGAN
Our **WCM-DCGAN** modifies the DCGAN architecture by incorporating a **Weather Conditioning Module** that introduces weather-specific features (rain, fog, snow, etc.) into the generated images. This module allows for high-quality synthesis of traffic signs that simulate real-world weather conditions.

### X-ViT
The adversarial dataset generated by our WCM-DCGAN was fed into an **Xception-backbone assisted Vision Transformer**, combining efficient feature extraction from Xception with the attention mechanism of transformers.

## Conclusion
By combining **WCM-DCGAN** for dataset augmentation and an **Xception-based Vision Transformer** for classification, this work enhances the accuracy of traffic sign recognition systems, particularly under adverse weather conditions. The generated images provide a rich dataset that improves model generalization, while the transformer architecture effectively learns the necessary features for accurate classification.
